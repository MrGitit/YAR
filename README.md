# YAR — YouTube Auto Reel

Beginner-friendly scaffold for an AI pipeline that:
- Generates a 45–55s script from a news summary (local LLM via Ollama)
- Narrates with TTS (Mimic3 by default)
- Renders visuals (ComfyUI SDXL stills or AnimateDiff)
- Exports a ready-to-post vertical video + captions

This repo currently contains the folder/file framework only.
